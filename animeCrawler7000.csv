jafarcakes,0,@bklynborn73 @KellyO @cindygallop You haven't read the piece. It contains absolutely no evidence of reinfection.

ohnor3i,0,@bossjong It's not really limited edition is they bring back a classic piece so they don't have a lot of it. When I saw yesterday I think they sold 1 piece and then left one more in stock only

ihaddadene_samy,0,This ships can be able to go to LOPG and dock back to ISS.  To come from or go back to earth  use classic ships from earth to ISS (Crew Dragon  Soyouz  Starliner ...) To land and back to moon surface use a real lander capable to land and to liftoff in one piece (2/3)

Dencoil,0,@CodeJack2468 now he will hate me more  but he made it clear to me that I'm worth less as a person than a piece of sh1t  so you know  I won't shut my mouth up. One of his pals  the one who started all  ThomasRai5  actually has his account suspended  but to be honest  this will never end.
BassnUke,0,People think it's so funny to make fun of One Piece because it's long. Well when I finally catch up to the current episode in a couple months they'll catch these hands

FurryMemes2,0,@p0tat0_Yuki The way they tried to present it to me back in catholic high school was some real doublethink. That it actually was a paradox and yet also amazing that there are three distinct entities and yet they are all one God. Like the triforce except each piece was also just all-powerful.

stophinkley,0,@tom_burke_47 Tom why is no one talking about tidal power? You don‚Äôt mention it in this piece. Swansea Tidal Lagoon would be up and running by now whereas Hinkley C like Flamanville may never get going @LukePollard @KwasiKwarteng @CarolineLucas

FrankieMac9,0,@LeaveFBPE @68PAD @johnredwood You miss the point. Where emergencies exist  countries have sovereign rights to pursue their own paths. Why do you think several EU members organised their own supplies of vaccines? By the way  that article makes it clear at the bottom that it‚Äôs an opinion piece. Nice one üëç
