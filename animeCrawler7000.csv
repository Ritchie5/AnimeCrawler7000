irisheygirl,11,You are still a fan if you: • don't hear a song upon it's release • don't watch every concert/live stream • dont buy every piece of merch • don't know everything going on • became a fan recently   Theres more than one way to be a fan. You are here now and thats what matters.

ReplyGuy_3,1,@AngloRemnant Honestly I’m a bit shocked by these retweets. Not one piece of dentistry content. Sad!
Bryan_Infiniti,1,I can already imagine your response. I'll make you a deal:  Give me 8 comic book films you love and I'll review them (all in one piece preferably but we can negotiate).   Only catch is that my deadline is minimum 4 months.

camewitthefetti,1,@MaestrosCorner DBZ I woulda said One Piece but I need toilets
FormalHoodie,1,@blagojevism I have a picture of me putting in the last piece too but I decided not to share that one because it’s too perverse.
ApertaAria,1,@JeffWellsRigInt The one potential silver lining is that this (albeit still flawed) piece was published in the NY Times  which may potentially inspire nominal synapse firings in the largely addled brains of its readership  leading to a RE-CONSIDERATION of their infantile mindsets on this virus.
ArifHasanNFL,0,The piece goes into why one might prefer run stuffers because of light boxes and the increased use of tite fronts in modern and successful NFL defenses (LA  Denver  Chicago) while citing some teams  like the Ravens  who have had good defenses with similar personnel up front https://t.co/dZql39svFX

WSJ ain't really looking to axe one of it's mainstays at the moment
roderickgraham,0,@Katja_Thieme I read this piece.   He posted it as a reply to one of my posts about him - not to engage but so that my followers could see it. I would say that someone who does not know all the backstory (as I didn't) would find all the accusations of lying very convincing  unfortunately.

JosephPlaugher,0,@dawsypoosays @ValkyreeO @Vaticuss @BernieSanders So yes  business owners DO risk a lot. What do you risk while taking a paycheck to help with one small piece of your employer's operation?

mythical_k,0,I take back everything I said about One Piece  I’ll read the manga and watch the anime at the same time and keeping my mouth shut because of my brother threatening to spoil it and annoys me with some bs crossover fake spoiler.
JEEM4802,0,@billy197629 Have had two open heart surgeries within a year of each other and still going. My surgeries involved aortic valve though  not blockages. Do what they tell you to do.  Second one piece of cake as far as the surgery-You'll do fine.  Not as scary as you think it will be.

GregRock11,0,@BearsMomma1 The cop was nothing but courteous and professional; Nika reciprocated by being uncooperative  belligerent  then forcibly resisted him.

JonatoPik,0,@SerenaMalyon From one artist to another  this piece is so intensely inspiring. I love it
justsee,0,@substack Gosh  didn't realise CTO had quite the rap sheet.  However I don't buy into the faux-left framing of Taibbi  Greenwald et al as toxic (b/c they don't buy into 'corporate' left narratives).  Annaleen's piece is a great example of that framing at one point.
