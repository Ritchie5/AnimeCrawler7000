XDiamondX90,1,We've known about SWSH for a little over 2 years now. It was revealed to us during Pokémon Day in 2019. In those months  we've seen nothing but hype from the fanbase.  E3 2019 initiated Dexit.  Would the fanbase hold SWSH in higher regard if Dexit didn't exist?
LawrenceM_WR,1,@TheSkullKidman @Malgai_2019 @PokeliYT Yeah in terms of utility  I remember Skarmory being pretty low-end  but I just adored that Pokemon as a whole. Corviknight just about took its spot wholesale in Gen 8  though because... wow. lol I love Corviknight in my team. Will always appreciate Skarmory  though.

timid_belle,0,I got an Apple Watch because I wanted to be healthier but also thought it would be cool to play Pokémon Go on it. Joke’s on me  Niantic stopped supporting Pokémon Go for Apple Watch back in 2019. I live under a rock.

NekoMays,0,@AshSolgaleos Where it all started to go downhill was USUM's announcement  people were pissed Pokemon were doing sister games again  and then lets go happened in 2018 which I thought was so bad to be in the community at that time  but then 2019 happened...at least 2019 was epic for anime doe
Pikachuxdoraem1,0,Ill give pokemon credit atleast it did has a better  Battle système then all the expert for 4 but that it.  I am glad that tecmo b Revived the franchises in 2019 with 1 & 2 port in the switch  i am happy said they still support the franchise
TheSkullKidman,0,@LawrenceM_WR @Malgai_2019 @PokeliYT Yeah   Skarmory isn't the most usefull   but he sure is still a very cool Pokémon to use I used him in two playthrough   when I replayed Emerald normally in July 2019   and when I played through Renegade Platinum in November 2020 (It worked pretty well with Tyranitar's ability) https://t.co/PBQpGx16EA

dywitch1991,0,Yui Kashima Yui Kashima BuzzFeed Staff  Japan  2019/09/29 2:59:18 GMT  The anime "Pokemon" that began broadcasting in 1997.  It's been 22 years since Pikachu and 10-year-old Satoshi  who can't enter the monster ball  started their journey.  Is it about once a month?
GooeyUi,0,@AShadowStreak Dang  you played every Pokemon game except Silver  Crystal  White 2  X  Ultra Sun  Let's Go Eevee  and Sword! Do you ever plan on going back and playing those 7 games to complete your streak?  Also  why'd you skip Gen 2 back then and not play them until presumably 2018/2019?

Meeper12346,0,@clownkure it was announced during a pokemon presentation with detective pikachu 2 (the game not the movie). we know nothing about it other than something about catching pokemon in your sleep and with the lack of news besides a single banner at a toy fair in 2019 it's presumed cancelled
