Kalt_Null,1,@nolan_mcbride @PhilipYount I hold it that THE BOYS (the series) is a MUCH better approach to "adult comic book stuff" than Lindeloff's WATCHMEN series  which I found... Just all kinds of bad and can't quite get how it got that popular...

Kalt_Null,0,@nolan_mcbride Snyder tho... His DC movies have fun set-pieces in them. But they are overall mostly just too long (if not WAY too long  I mean...

nolan_mcbride,0,@Kalt_Null @PhilipYount Yup. Feels like THE BOYS made a lot of the same critiques as Snyder has been focused on in his DC work  but they did them well and managed to be entertaining on top of it. Also managed to avoid most of Garth Ennis‚Äô edgelord tendencies in the process.
