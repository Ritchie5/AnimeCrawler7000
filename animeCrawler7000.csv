ourobororoboruo,17,I was browsing comments under this piece on Facebook and unexpectedly teared up when one of the commenters recognized that satire can come from a place of pain and rage.  I feel seen.

ARSONBLADE,6,once i got a piece off of one of these chairs and tried to eat it https://t.co/w2Kcloop5t
VeronicaChaos,5,I’ve been feeling like crap all week and literally the only thing I want to do is eat twizzlers and watch One Piece.  Gonna get some twizzlers tomorrow and make all my dreams come true.
ig1ari,5,cookie run kingdom is just one piece whole cake island
MJPlitnick,5,This is a supremely powerful piece from @NathanThrall  It's one Palestinian's tragic story  but it serves as a perfect allegory for the life of Palestinians under decades of #Israeli occupation. Must read.  A Day in the Life of Abed Salama  https://t.co/hT65oRTkwW
kikubestgirl,5,i want more adventure anime like dr stone and one piece i cant process all the action in shounens rn
mints4christ,3,Another blessing sent out on behalf of our fund courtesy of @elrokk with his first piece The King ? this one is for @SeviLovesArt who is 8 and loves to do art! I won't highlight exactly why because he is an artist like El Rokk and is only 8 years old! God bless you little Sevi! https://t.co/qMw0YtAo3F
AssassinTWT,2,Feels like almost every week new news come outs about a content creator not being who you thought they were  with each one i feel a piece of me get ripped away because it goes to show that you really never truly know someone.
DepressingJunko,2,Starting one piece rn lets see what this show got.
CashCidChris,2,@PapiJeem watchin one piece
artschooldrop,2,i also think counting the amount of scenes of minorities in one piece of corporate owned content and comparing it to virtually the same piece of content is moronic smooth brained behavior
yatagarasue,2,YOOOOOOOO i can finally get my hands on the one piece of ace attorney merch i’ve been craving so desperately my entire life; the ever elusive ace attorney hankerchief
smiles4karl,2,one  day  i  want  to  write  down  everything  that  bothers  me  or  makes  me  sad  on  a  piece  of  paper  and  burn  it
gothwebs,2,so   i bought this hoodie when i was like 16? and it is one of my absolute favorite!! piece of miw merch that i own  and unfortunately it’s not as comfy and oversized bc of how my mom washed it yeaaaars ago (she also hid it from for literal YEARS?? bc she didn’t like it?) https://t.co/KRU2iT9ZQx
two_n_minus_one,2,@della_morte_ thank you so much. ? i wish i could share a piece of it  because you deserve it too  and the world besides.   i should probably head to bed because the meds are kicking in. please have sweet dreams whenever you get there. i'll do the same.
DodoEri,2,I can casually write a 100 page text about one piece and it’s story but can’t  with world war 1 ?this is starting to get out of hand
sina_lana,2,@jessicamalaty @EpiEllie https://t.co/owqZ0oPGr8 This is one of the things I found worst in this piece. There was no need to make up a new meaning for "vaccinated". There's enough vax disinformation without adding a new layer of confusion.
sopehell,1,yoongi on lunch break sharing a table with his coworkers and the conversation going in one ear and out the other bc he just thought of a PERFECT piece of dialogue for his wip and hes writing it out in his head

TurtleRaiser,1,A piece of San Diego history has been leveled to one small pile as of 5:45 today.  Our beloved stadium. The Murph or the Q. How ever you know it as  So many fun memories.  It’s like saying goodbye to a friend... ?? https://t.co/3xTeP779rn
yeoImeu,1,one piece of lost media in kpop that i can never stop thinking about is the alleged jungsis album

CashCidChris,1,@based_grapes one piece
danieldumby,1,#TheSnyderCut is a piece of art. It isn’t just a super hero movie. It isn’t just a movie. It somehow managed to become one of my favorite pieces of fiction of all time. I am stunned.
_h0ekage_,1,also  not me being hurt but someone who has an anime avi on insta AND it’s cropped all weird so it doesn’t even fit in the circle right AND it’s from one piece BYE
CahRonShooM,1,@CreativeName_0 @zoroblackgf WAIT A FUCKIGN MINUTE IF YOU ATE A DEVIL FRUIT THEN HOW COME YOU SAID YOU'D LEARN HOW TO SWIM  Either you're a liar or you haven't read One Piece. Either way you're going to solitary confinement
HexAtRest,1,@cozstr Overall my main problem with this piece is that is just so bland and expressionless  the expectancy of a child coming is supposed to be one of the most beautiful ever in the life of a future parent (or something like that idk)  but this piece fails to transmit that  even kokichi-
LiamOliverNutri,1,If I could give anybody one piece of advice it would be: take advice.   Great points here!  “…pay attention to the language you use. Like it or not  the manner in which a message is received is heavily influenced by the manner in which the message is formulated.”  ???? https://t.co/GEQ84woLEd

endxeternal0,1,Showed my sister one piece tonight and it was like the first time I felt like I havent annoyed someone when showing them or talking to someone about it
mama_pause,1,@SolveExistence @ragipsoylu Oh  yeah  right. That's why he's gotten more done in 56 days that the Trump WH and majority in Congress got done in 4 years. They got one piece of major legislation through at the end of their first year in the majority: tax cuts for the 1% and robbing middle class of tax cuts.

Ricardo15294790,0,@Steveygs @meghanstheworst Yeah  it's STANDARD who is gonna compare something Standard to shows like FMAB  Yu Yu Hakusho  DBZ  One Piece  etc  and say yeah this show is better than all of these or on their level.
Ngizokhuluma,0,@valavoosh I read this when I wrote a short piece for my local newspaper some time ago and I was fascinated at how the 'Africanists' left the ANC and then led one of those history changing events in SA. I still dream of hearing his voice.
LoneWol10175595,0,Remember fellas canada still produces and exports automatic STEN guns and getting one to the USA will only cost you a federal license for automatic weapons and about $250 for a brand new off the shelf piece of history that just wont die :)

tacotime81,0,@2nickels One time  I threw a piece of piece of cheese at my dog. She loves cheese but does not love my shenanigans  so she didn't even try to catch it. Somehow  it landed squarely on the top of her head  and she sat and scowled at me until I fed it to her like the Proper Lady she is.
iPegTaehyung,0,I should watch one piece
bexkollstedt,0,My love for anything birthday cake flavored has not led me wrong yet. I might have spent a little more on one bottle than I’d like to spend but this @prairieales Corner Piece was well worth it! ? https://t.co/yVCJjpxFZw
DJBisogno,0,Unreal that it’s over  but what an athlete to witness in his prime.  Glad to know I’ll have seen a piece of history in the making. Khabib was and is one of the greatest of all time. Can’t wait to see how his coaching career goes. 29-0-0. https://t.co/dMqIKG2tpV

BestYeen,0,@Jonathan_Blow @fabricatedmath @BartoszMilewski I've implemented a compiler and language runtime and a bunch of computationally very demanding stuff in Hs after many years of C++/C#  and it enabled me to handle so much more complexity than I could in those other languages. Purity is only one puzzle piece of that.
s7ntii,0,@Om1arX We watching one piece!!
elmariewepener,0,Pm did not listen. Because he takes one piece of Scripture and prefers to forget about the rest. This page is dying because Pm is NOT OPEN TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. He believes you turn into a saint at your conversion. Reader he kills God shouting at him with his belief. Im silent.
