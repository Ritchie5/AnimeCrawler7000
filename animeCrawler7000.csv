JDVance1,795,My Newsweek piece on the border crisis includes one of the craziest experiences of my life: when a major hotel CEO complained bitterly that “Trump’s immigration policy” had forced him to raise wages.  https://t.co/gemmpJ5xQ0
Mikel_Jollett,258,So you reduce the suffering of brown people to “greed ” you ignore the wars  violence they face  the bravery they must show to even attempt to emigrate and instead focus your entire piece on one hotelier you met once.  I don’t even understand how this argument could be printed.

GregRudd1,0,@Staplefordtrain @idriveaclassic @60163_Tornado The PRR T1 new build will eclipse that. The modified frame design made up of a combination of casting and full penetration welding will be stronger let alone cheaper than the original one piece casting design. A very American heavy engineering approach.

NormanFongOchoa,0,@Umairuem @nachtmys @YQpfY30OFdnI46z @WSJ_manga True. He needs to have impressed the japanese audience to rack enough votes for him to reach that place  just like Bartolomeo in One Piece; in the first poll he was eligible  he made into the top 10 with little trouble.

JoshLaBean,0,@luxthos Seems like I’d rather get a game pad. Because swapping to only using this and losing the function of my num pad and other keys could be rough. It seems like a really well designed piece of hardware though!  Does Corsair make a game pad?  I’ve never seen one.

ImJustCath,0,@ULTRAVOID_ Different pieces speak differently to different people! One piece of art could give millions a vapid chuckle  and another could change one person's entire life.  We just want more of you!~ Don't judge yourself based on numbers.
Arthur_A_Vtuber,0,@_T4N3 There is no such thing as a pure original idea anymore  hasn't been for thousands of years. Every piece of art is influenced in one way or another by what came before it  and is simply an interpretation of those inspirations. Your interpretations are just as artistically valid
