Chilesh21452008,0,@f_yambo Ck had one foot outside the door. You cannot have an agreement with someone who is not fully committed. CK is going back to PF & I expect that his 30 nmc members will declare the party null & void. It will be a defection of all his followers. The drama was just an excuse.
