drowsynra,17,i have this one piece of art i keep putting under artist support threads but never rlly posted it properly bcs SOMEONE keeps stalling their own goddamn resurrection  might post it tomorrow since i haven’t been providing that much art lately
PokemanZ0N6,8,Only one piece  SD and AoT can be compared (and they're all better) https://t.co/T3muvVJRxb
hannibalscript,7,Just the one piece.
michaelxpettis,5,Interesting piece. It seems that after the Facebook scare central banks embraced digital currency mainly because no one wanted to fall behind. But fall behind in what? No one really seems to know.  https://t.co/2Cb4sxkbER
liminal_warmth,5,The closest analogy I can come up with is like if you're issuing numbered and signed prints of a piece of work but sometimes agree to only create one such print.  Yet they confer no usage rights and are digital.
Infernasu,4,"What does that matter? We were talking about One Piece." https://t.co/ykAdx0i9DP
_Noiirr,3,Me waiting for more like.  I don't know how it's went from this beautiful piece of art to the Joss Whedon one and honestly I don't care  I don't want to know    So just tell me that there's something coming in the nearest future #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague https://t.co/7fbvkhK1bH
meredithcastles,3,Um  @KrystalDeNapoli I asked an impartial judge about our chances of making it out in one piece tonight. The news isn’t good ????????  See you tonight Twitch peeps!  ?LIVE ~7:30pm AEDT?  #RealAsylum  #BatteryLow  #SoundScapes  https://t.co/RE8sIIkE4W https://t.co/jqPrPDLEdA https://t.co/RVJicb91d8
JPCastlin,2,This is an excellent piece  as one would expect  by @gilliantett in @FT. Illustrates my argument in the 2021 Manifesto on emergent-deliberate balancing in global strategy perfectly - and that strategy is much more than just sacrifice.  Via @Rbambrick86.  https://t.co/et9IYvE353
weare1of100,2,which he started compiling just before lockdown. Every piece has a lovely  thought provoking story to accompany it which immediately puts a smile on your face. Job well done ?   I can’t wait to launch the design  the hardest part will be deciding which one as I love them all!
MirandaTHolmes,2,@churchnw6 Tbh it’s not very solid - while we keep an eye out for a proper old big one  we’ve got a repro one with a piece of hardboard on top to make it wide enough for a)the room and b)books between plates as we all read at the table ? He assured me he’d aimed for the solid part!
fuburyo,2,@kaitotenjoirl even if GX rly distracted me they're still super important to me... I'M EXCITED TO WORK ON A PIECE FOR THE ZINE  Venus is one of my first ygo fandom friends actually LOL
Yvng_Nicks,2,@SaljuNativa Hmm well my favourite is Shonen jump like one piece  naruto  dragon ball  and etc  But if you have different genre sure!!! I want to try different
nxatez,2,btw i’m reading one piece now and ima post some of the sexy panels i come across. i’m pretty much caught up so spoil warning ?
eidilramsey,2,don’t be a human if you can’t be a good one. be a piece of shit instead
ISayPorter,2,@Otto_English Lots of things to be proud of in Britain. Yer dad impregnating yer mam on the Corkscrew at Alton Towers 'ain't one of them. A piece of cloth isn't  either. And neither is the shower of kleptomaniac fascists currently calling themselves the government.
PokemanZ0N6,2,Also any naotoshi shida or ryo onishi peak >>> Madhouse animation peaks except OPM because of bones animators  And this is even pre-wano for one piece
ftrpirateking,2,Prayer circle my friend watches one piece. ???
stephenkeeler,1,Following @nancycampbelle ‘s piece in yesterday’s @guardian I put together my Ten Tracks from my Travels. Love the idea. Thinking of building one of my creative writing courses around it. https://t.co/PgFVcdwnIo
RobertCow_,1,@xlnft Splendid and gorgeus work! I love and enjoy EVERY piece of your composition! ALL of them are genious and beatiful but my favorite is the one on your title list!
mars_stu,1,Twitter can be an awful place  but every now and again I come across a piece of art on here that takes my breath away and makes me want to stay. Like this one... https://t.co/gqeoSt7Ns3
hfrcapital,1,@puppyeh1 @WillThrower3 @daniel_toloko ? if you have a run like this & retire on it  no matter how much you love the company or how big the remaining upside  you have to diversify. He is literally betting his lifestyle on one company (which I think is an overvalued piece of trash but that is just my own opinion).
HanaaMu67443566,1,@Ahmadsoueidan This piece can tap on places in one's soul they didn't even know existed. And isn't that what music is all about? Replacing language when it fails to articulate humans' pain

YourAnimeGuy,1,Aight so  Tpn s2 is trash i don't care what ya say Hxh has been on hiatus too fucking long Anime studios better start animating second seasons  Tatsuya Matsuki is a bitch  Magi needs a final season My Hero is over hyped Cage of Eden needs an anime One Piece anime needs a reboot
Punk0PoPs,1,Love how my boss is watching One Piece during breaktime.
micdropmaki,1,I didn't know there were neros in one piece?! https://t.co/lme9BFdLXZ
Maegraeth,1,@sirkreuab If we were to go serious then yes  you're probably right ?But the piece is based on the promise two innocent children made one night  as well as a look at what the GS date might look like in later parts.
izum1iori,1,I wanna try drawing a piece with this kind of colour scheme one day...maybe when I'm done with comms https://t.co/c2a2sbo0s6
joeneville_,1,@Julio_PDX One piece of advice that I follow for blogs  try to avoid any large blocks of text when covering technical details.  I write it all out  then break it up into multiple headers and try to reduce it down to concise bullet points.  That makes it much easier for readers.

nosuchseagull,1,?? Googling the #DaddyLonglegs is a mistake  because this creature you never get too close to  and which looks pleasantly enough like a semicolon on eight spindly legs  is suddenly magnified. Now it looks like a pitch pipe mated with a lobster.   https://t.co/DMJv8F1YHu https://t.co/fFM9v0oRNl

RaiyanAhmad04,0,@SDetective5 @GrandLineReview @LazarosVas @ZnabbyKhan Chill man. One piece is an epic. Of course it will have such super human achievement. Oda is trying to protray surrealism not realism.

mrsBr1ghtside,0,@Yorkshireantiqu @presslstore They are lol. I have the fox/wolf one  and spent more time putting it back together than actually doing the puzzle! Every time you put a piece in  other pieces move around... would rather just have a normal jigsaw puzzle I think!

nomanaking,0,@alexmillar It 2:49am here and I was genuinely puzzled by the “wtf” preceding your question. I forgot that adjective has historically been used pejoratively by racists. I simply meant that my puff piece was not very elaborate and I would welcome a more complex one.

LitheNightshade,0,@RoshiMister @jlist Not to mention a girl can wear a one piece and later on get a bikini to make the reveal even better. Can't really do it in reverse. Sure the other girl can get a new bikini  but would it have the same effect? Thought you would have a more diverse palete Roshi.

jonahmyerslyric,0,i brought down one small piece of autumn to those submarine flowers just to prove that i was sorry and then i was out on the ocean alone cause i had to resurface to breathe
dampHandshake,0,instead I got a piece of art that they sold on posters at Sam Goody but one really is way worse than the other
ethannnjoness,0,@Scoutwitnobrayn @TheHoopCentral @espn Experience.. and confidence. Who knows  they might have went out and got another piece via trade or free agency. Even the previous year  that 4-1 series loss was as lot closer then 4-1 e bulls were in every game. With more experience  seasoned Rose. I think they get one.
lslouffm,0,You want to celebrate International Women’s Month? Start by doing your family’s laundry. Correctly. Not with one piece done strategically wrong so you won’t have to do it again.
YGNJAMS95,0,Me: i will watch one piece and naruto once I finish watching all the animes on my list   Also me: *continue adding animes on my list*   So self  when will you finish? ?
LitheNightshade,0,@RoshiMister @jlist It's about the allure of imagination. All one piece swimsuits give you the curves the wearer  but hide most of the skin beneath. It leaves you wanting more. Bikinis and super revealing swimsuits are like new strips of gum. Delicious and full of flavor  but quickly fades away.
