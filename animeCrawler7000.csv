R0AN,14,tfw no one piece chapter this week https://t.co/awiZ1YxOWr
ArifHasanNFL,8,I just explained how I did work to "figure out how it could be effective" which would mean I'm doing more than "only criticizing" -- the conclusion one draws in a piece is not the totality of the piece. I'm not going to lie about how I think a move will work out. https://t.co/nRGsQTNwtw
timethehobo,8,LRT> What in the actual fuck man. Being a piece of shit racist? That's one issue already. Being a piece of absolute garbage racist who attacks the ELDERLY? You need a pole up your ass and the same whopping you tried to give the old folks before getting kicked right into the sun.
PhilWMagness,6,I'm not sure what hearing the author of this piece watched  but it wasn't the one that aired today on tv. Paul asked pointed questions. Fauci stumbled and blathered incoherently  then coughed out an empty platitude about masks. https://t.co/JAZV9vgUIW

Flaffenbam,4,@AngryOrange123 @originalnilson @All_Mr_Serious @GoblinQChesh @GoldennUnicornn @MissusCare .  For one  it's just a touchy subject in general. And second  if you are wrong you have just made someone upset because you have accused them of something which is a touchy subject.  Anyhoo  said my piece.  Toodle-oo
wtffaygo,4,One Piece is the best anime/manga out of every single one
tom_cho,4,"We spend so much time fighting over whether trans women should be kept in women’s prisons  when we could be fighting for a world without prisons in it." Following on from one of my recent tweets  here is a thought-provoking 2019 piece by Kai Cheng Thom. https://t.co/CocB0pqLrt
Alexischangg,2,this popcorn right here is so damn deceptive bc there’s rlly only one good piece every 30-35 pieces but that one good pieces taste so damn good that i keep going back and buying more? https://t.co/GmVqo5wS1D

KONOBANANANA,2,@ig1ari You caught up to one piece you can handle the stupid lawyer game cmon
janajwrites,2,@bedmint @OminousHallways I already put it away for tonight  but I’ll take one when I eat another piece tomorrow ?
ArcticCircleSys,2,Like we have most of the pieces to fix it  but there's one piece missing meaning we won't be able to fix one of the keys. Guess what? We can't replace that piece and it's tiny as fuck so it's near impossible to find if it's not right next to the laptop! ~Nai
FreddyFlatRate,2,One tone GB hit me with a 2 piece when he was 4. I knew he was a menace to society then
NetSematary,2,"You know Miller Lite only has one more calorie  right?"  Motherfucker  just ring up my shit. You're a cashier in a bodega at midnight  don't fucking judge me you piece of shit.
FilmBrief,2,I’m no gallerist but if I was one  would defo try to work with Lipsmak...    You cannot mistake or forget a Lipsmak piece! ? https://t.co/gmndYtPcih
CdnAdvocacy,2,Excellent piece @brianlilley  one fix needed  End the doctatorship & #medicaltyranny...  Clearly one new requirement must include all proposed orders  laws & mandates must have a #Charter analysis done & published  w #scientificevidence to support them.   https://t.co/Y5loWqc7yg
Zethran00,1,@Katzetote we finally found it. the one piece.
ManUtdInUSA,1,One can be mindful of the melodies or themes  the harmony  the driving or relaxed rhythms  the color of the sounds  the activity of a piece  how the sounds are produced  or how they all relate to one another.  @acebergtm @sir_justine #FarFromHomeEp https://t.co/JMhGPkzJWW https://t.co/UCw5EwxGN2

kittencarl1,1,@LustfulTigress It was a 3cm long piece of wood railing that went through one side of my finger and partially out the other. It  broke inside my finger and the doc had to really dig around in it to get everything out.??

Ghostietea,1,We're doing WAY better than pre-reboot when there was one (1) piece of official merch for her in existence but please    I crave shirt    I crave figurine   
LeonValentineW,1,@akumace1 @DonieDarko3 @GaarnZ @VTuberCringe Most of these people have only watched the most mainstream anime  like SAO  Dragon Ball  Naruto  One Piece  Demon Slayer and My Hero Academia. You can't really call those people anime watchers. And they're the ones quickest to criticize the inner aspects of otaku culture.
dogepod_,1,@memeguider Felt  one of the few shows I've tried with  not the last piece of media to make me cry was literally a sea shanty lmao  it just went over my feelings of loss so well

Kneevirus,1,@LSMark_ If one of your reasons for hating something is the fanbase or cause it's popular  grow up? Every fanbase as bad eggs and the bigger a franchise is the easier it is to see them don't let that stop you from enjoying a game or any piece of media really

cooklikeamac,0,I don’t know what kind of Asians you’re or chill with but when I was growing up in North Portland  if you messed with one of us you got a piece of all of us.
punpunpunpun,0,@walkeysplanet im not reading berserk until MAYBE i get to timeskip in one piece.
pacemori,0,In a Black-and-white world  Asians survive by living a furniture existence.   Stay quiet  play dumb  work hard  keep your head down  be so accommodating that no one can separate you from a piece of furniture. If none of us makes any noise  they might not notice that we’re here.
hinatadoris,0,i got a really good 4 set crimson piece sitting on my inventory but no one to give it to

TH3ANDRIOD,0,Looking back  the beginning of the one piece anime is so hard to watch. No wonder people get turned off by it. It just isn’t appealing at all.
LunaticTankie,0,@MarxBot2 @romeoisdaddy @Lukasdieschild1 Not tonite.  Only one more day to work and I've had a few drinks.  You are still a piece of shit tho.

8otchway,0,@Luck_Voltiaxxx @Your_GFs_Simp ong  like would someone ever say demon slayer better than  one piece or death note sales can indicate quality BUT w how wsj is rn  its moreso about the money than anything else  why they're letting more series end. they'd rather short term success w lots of sales +
Picklemaddierix,0,@pissGoblin wait sanji the kick cook from one piece??

CogitoVonTweet,0,@fisher4450 @RMarchNZ If they were allowed to  developers could make a lot more money building apartments. If you can get dozens of units out of the same piece of land vs one mansion  you'll generally go for the apartments provided there is demand (i.e. inner cities). Our rules just prevent it.

tempoC7,0,@ReluctantActvst @emrazz and I was not talking about that.  I said just return the amount of a single sperm cell  to the sperm donor  either the one you think it is  or do a DNA test (if he agrees) to be sure.  a piece of hair would be more than enough  and both of you would be settled.
Icelandic_Troll,0,Can’t stand Luke’s attempt at singing  guitar playing  or song writing. Also  has he made one piece of jewelry all summer?  Typical model — just looking the part  no substance #summerhouse
