GermanSanJuan2,0,I still say the choice of putting rap music as an American OP for things like One Piece and Dragon Ball GT wasn't themselves bad. The bad thing was each rap had to rap out the plot of the show  there's only SO much flow you can do being like 'Goku's a kid again.'

iamartemisfowl,0,@Diana__Winters @alejour1 @pradasword If the US collapsed  the federal government would also fracture  along with the control of the Military.
