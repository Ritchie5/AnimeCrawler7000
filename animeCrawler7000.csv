CelticBlog2018,38,Absolutely honking goal to lose yet again and the argument against retaining a single one of these "coaches" in a nutshell. Defensive organisation 101 is put a guy on each post for a set piece. Kennedy et al cannot even do the simple stuff. Dire.

kittaekoos,0,as he picks up a piece of pork  he gets a cooked onion or garlic  and some green onion salad and places it on top. He folds the lettuce leaf over it and pops it into his mouth in one go.   He moans in satisfaction as the taste melts in his mouth. It's so savory.
