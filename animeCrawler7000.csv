Madberry05,7,I never understood why ppl hate on this scene so much. Was it because it felt like a NS moment? Or because Sakura acknowledged Naruto's strength  unlike what the antis constantly said?  Cuz to me it was such an epic scene? He showed up when she needed him never letting her down😭 https://t.co/LDGRY1bfwl

nickmarquise,2,Naruto is and was the most annoying and unlikeable character.   Neji’s d*ath was absolutely pointless and unnecessary.   Jiraiya was ass.  Far too much filler content. https://t.co/Nujf9kjuBN

Talk2ndSkeet1st,0,Watching naruto and drinking is actually pretty good
kimochii_waruii,0,@_rinnegone Nah. I disagree. Mikio is leaning into fan nostalgia to keep the fence sitters in the book long enough to win them over. Sasuke and Naruto do the heavy lifting the entire first half of Boruto.
