vincent5126,0,@miggyluisito_ @rakirude Black Clover is too short for a weekly binge. MHA is the middle ground for time with probably the best art in Jump. One Piece has the meaty package. The latter two are my chapter of the week contenders I will probably get to JJK when Mappa finishes season 1.
botmanda,0,shit like this is why I left the one piece fandom  they are so toxic and put each other down. I used to be a fan of zoro and luffy but then their fans say bad things about Sanji  now I only like him.

taeshakkkk,0,One piece is actually good from the first episode. Imagine starting in the middle of nowhere and having no idea how luffy got to where he is   how he got his crew   how his skills got better  how he became famous. Imagine missing all of thatüò≠
SebTHArts,0,@FunsexyDB the likelihood of UA surviving -this arc- one is extremely low.  Makes me wonder how Horikoshi is going to continue once this interim piece finishes.

wanjianchang,0,it's actually been such an awful past few months. the few times i try to celebrate my wins are left with half-assed replies or just being completely ignored.  how am i supposed to not feel like a complete piece of shit when these things keep happening? no one actually cares...

Heyyuke_art,0,One more step  i think. There are certainly things about this piece that i'm not happy with. But i'm hoping it still turns out okay.  More on my insta: https://t.co/4qfmduigJz #posca #poscapens #dtiys #tiger #art #acrylic #animal #wip #ArtistOnTwitter https://t.co/DHL2qD9m9F

AustenMu,0,@Sonof17762 @AngelaTandarich @VV1965 @LeaderMcConnell One piece of legislation on voting at the state level would make it illegal to provide water & snacks to those standing in line for multiple hours to vote. Instead of adapting their policies to gain more voters  GOP will just prevent more Americans from voting!
