nano_bolt,115,So beautiful! The episode was so beautiful  Sumire   Kawaki and Naruto  They knew the pain  the fear and the sadness. Sumire understood it well  her kindness was so beautiful   she almost gained Kawaki's trust  But She didn't need to explain much  Naruto just understood it all! https://t.co/z0M6UmBioy

Mnny_Tz,70,It’s not about rejecting criticism  Naruto was always going to make a decision for himself as to what to do with Kawaki.

Momoshikkiii,38,Ok there are some complaints about this latest Boruto ep  shouldn’t Kawaki have less knowledge about the outside world? Also why is he less cold? It wasn’t really Kawaki. Also they shouldn’t have showed Naruto using kurama mode to kawaki  how is he gonna be surprised now?
vaiyolota,35,Yes  yes you have. ?? He got both Sumire and Naruto who will understand him very well. I like how they make Sumire talk about him  she make them think more positive and not only see him as a dangerous boy/monster. She understand his fears.  #kawaki #sumire #naruto #boruto https://t.co/v3xqi9J5e4
bonamize,34,Concerning Kawaki  I believe Naruto’s decision was mostly made but Sumire vouching for Kawaki could have been the last reassurance he needed. https://t.co/TMcxxWqxL3
blazing_eyed,25,Y’all in my mentions saying “not true” when naruto in the manga wouldn’t even lock kawaki up prior to meeting him properly while in the anime he was a ok  with it agrees he’s a danger and wants to meet him first.

truvaliez,13,@JoyBoyKing @Alex_Kurosaki_ @dailymikasaku 1.) she manipulated naruto to not get his killed  which shikamaru and sai told her to do2.) Making fun of an orphan? are you forgetting when naruto mocked the uchiha clan and sakura apologized AT THE END OF THE EPISODE.3.) When did she EVER almost get her friends killed for sasuk
Momoshikkiii,13,In the manga  Kawaki was really anti social and so cold that even a kid bumping into him was considered a threat. Also shouldn’t he have been more threatening than in the manga? It feels like he’s already developed before the naruto treatment

thearraira,9,Kawaki didn't even try to slap her hand away  and to knock it all on the head  she managed to keep a hold on his arm later for a third time.  I also love the scene where #Sumire was talking with #Naruto  and mentioned the fact that #Kawaki was just like her ?  #KawaSumi

hakimbukit,7,JJK opening got me hyped like 11 years old me bopping to naruto op
AdekanmbiDanie2,7,@blazing_eyed Ofc naruto would be careful he has people to protect in the village it hasn't diminished anything sumire doesn't have to tell him to give him a chance until he does naruto would always give people chances even if they are his enemies
blazing_eyed,7,Naruto is the most compassionate person in the series and the belief that he needs somebody to tell him to give kawaki a chance as a adult is mind boggling. He was iffy asf when on the train with sai until sumire’s speech.
animevibeeee,6,@slucciii He isn't the monster that he believes he is. Kawaki is not his father  nor Jigen  but his past pushes him to believe & become that. Fortunately Naruto is the one to help him break and realise that false inheritance. ?

Broulder,6,I've found myself listening to the Naruto soundtrack a lot recently when I'm doing stuff.   Forgot how good a lot of it is
Antwon1101,6,@Momoshikkiii In terms of Naruto  what I’m hoping for is the anime to differentiate the difference between kind hokage Naruto Kurama mode  vs menacing Kurama mode. Naruto did block the blast  but it didn’t look like he released a lot of his nine tails energy. I’ll just wait and see?
0_heartless0,6,It was a risky move  showing Naruto in action this early into Kawaki's anime debut. However  it was pulled off really well  and this was a generally good  calmer sorta episode.  Kawaki and Sumire's dynamic is one I can't wait to see touched upon more. Next episode's preview tho..

blazing_eyed,6,And naruto wasn’t always gonna take him in in the anime version. His words were “i wanna meet him first” manga naruto outright refused to confine kawaki and opted to take him in instead.
kyngromaine,5,I swear some people don’t understand Naruto character at all he would bring Kawaki to the village no matter what happens ?
SaoudSays,5,@Momoshikkiii I understand that but the manga has never really given us more to his character until he reached Konoha. He felt bad about the Vase immediately. So that good side has always been there. Besides  I'm glad they're filling the gap between him being past out & waking up to see Naruto https://t.co/l681qlAXoV
animevibeeee,5,@Momoshikkiii @Antwon1101 Naruto was actually angry and menacing in the manga and defensive in this episode. That will be the moment when Kawaki will realise his real potential and compare it to Jigen's.

RavenAveira,4,Yall: Naruto was gonna give him a chance and take him in anyway! you clearly didnt watch the episodes  If Naruto had already decided to give him a chance he wouldnt have gone along with him being confined  and he would have been firm against Sai and Shikamaru instead of wavered. https://t.co/fi5Wj3HFLL

KylianNeta,4,@Momoshikkiii I think manga really has too much influence on our mindset or indeed the studio wants to start building Kawaki's character from now on  they want to show Kawaki still has that feeling m Why is he still able to cry and care about Naruto when he finds out about his past
YURENQI,4,i don’t even watch naruto bc its ass but sakura is better than everyone https://t.co/KusUqYi41p
0_heartless0,4,Okay  to touch upon what I meant by it being a "risky move"  was due to that this scene here  is pretty important  as this is like the first time that Kawaki is seeing just a taste of Naruto's power. Having it shown too early could be sorta problematic.   Thankfully  it wasn't. https://t.co/Nj3nq3YOiT

blazing_eyed,4,He looked unsure if to give kawaki a chance because of sai and shikamaru. You can’t tell me sumire wasn’t a deciding factor in helping naruto fully resolve with the choice he made
Mnny_Tz,4,@itsumosad I agreed that wasn’t necessary  but also am saying it doesn’t affect him much. Naruto was looking at Kawaki from the viewpoint that he’s a child since before the train to Ryutan.

Antwon1101,3,@Momoshikkiii I think Naruto blocking the attack didn’t really show the menacing chakra. I think Kawaki was scared in the manga because from how it looked  the whole room was vibrating to Naruto’s chakra. In some cases it is shown that Naruto’s Kurama chakra is warm and comforting

Momoshikkiii,2,@Antwon1101 Still wouldn’t kawaki be able to tell the menacing chakra? Especially that Naruto blocked his attack?
MediBotEve,2,I hit chapter 350 of Naruto's manga!
KylianNeta,2,@Momoshikkiii For Kurama mode there is a slight difference I think in the manga when Naruto shows  it really is a huge overflow of chakara  after all from Kawaki's sentence he only emphasizes Naruto's strength Not in the form of kurama mode

DruidDobby,2,@VictroAdam @mayohiga1 Well when you think about it  Kushina still had the fox sealed inside of her when she gave birth to Naruto.   So perhaps instead of Naruto gaining the whiskers after birth  they were more of a hereditary trait passed down through Kushina during pregnancy. ?????

whawkinsMW,2,@shonen_ouji I think with the Naruto argument it’s due to the fate/reincarnation thing feeling a little forced and last minute  where with OP there have been hints and breadcrumbs thrown throughout the series. That and Naruto vs Neji was mostly about combating fate

AdiFreezeYouAll,2,@blazing_eyed According to some folk  no one else   other than Naruto can show compassion to Kawaki. If they do  that’s diminishing naruto’s. Like wow. Sumire told naruto about what she felt and what she wanted for kawaki  it did not affect any of naruto’s decisions.

itsumosad,2,@Phoebe54943950 @Mnny_Tz You’re missing the point. I’m talking about how her whole speech was unnecessary BECAUSE of how naruto is. It does nothing except undermine his natural way to operate; first they established a Kawaki x Sumire connection first and then he’s being implored to be compassionate
Mnny_Tz,2,@itsumosad I assume you meant he ? Naruto already looked at him from the perspective that he was a child. He was also the one who allowed Sumire to continue having residence in the village despite almost destroying it. It was unnecessary dialogue from Sumire  but didn’t change much.
Phoebe54943950,2,@itsumosad @Mnny_Tz Bro- it's as if you people haven't watched Naruto?Naruto did listen to what Sumire had to say but he wasn't affected by it  he has ALWAYS done what HE THINKS is best! Sumire's words didn't "make him re-think his decisions about Kawaki" wtf?!?

enoch0002,1,@blazing_eyed Your acting like even if sumire didn’t say anything and naruto got to the scene he wouldn’t have seen in kawakis eyes that he’s a boy in need of help.  Like are u forgetting he saw it in sasukes eyes when he was just a young kid?
daneteeter,1,@SeveredSonsDnD Compared between those two  Jutsu all the way. I've always found wands to be a wee bit lame. So the prospect of wiggling one around like I'm conducting the world's most chaotic orchestra while yelling silly bastardized Latin doesn't strike me as "cool". Plus  Naruto is bad ass.

itsumosad,1,@Mnny_Tz No I meant she* referring to Sumire. If Naruto didn’t have enough compassion then she just wouldn’t be here  so not only is the speech unnecessary but it’s also weird she’d feel the need to implore Naruto after being given a pass from him  that’s what I mean

TheMacaron_kun,0,@Nachtnights @cBm__7 You can use your brain and still end up being wrong.  None of us know who died (if anyone). Naruto and Sasuke might be dead  but we don't KNOW. It's not fact.  We'll be told later  but we haven't been told yet.  Even if it's highly likely  it's still not canon.

ShamScotty,0,@XavierLamarWar2 @AjthreetJ @Boruto_EN With that being said if someone was able to stop her then they should have.

Calamatuim,0,@Hp_Preys @Christi02577799 @saammyylicious @LeEvilMay @Deggs123 Except Sakura was never a Naruto protagonist. But even still so what? I never once said all of Naruto backstories are complex or the best.  @saammyylicious made a broad statement and I presented a counterargument that they didn't agree with.  Tsunade's backstory still clear tho
llilyseas,0,@Corvus_Brachyr @kreldeprince HUH?? THIS NARUTO SHT?

narutonlines,0,are u naruto fans? follow me :)
UraBytes,0,MHA is not really a bright series  it has a lot of dark tones since chapter 1 but I doubt it will go similar to AOT's writing route  Izuku's depression state is probably similar to what happened to Naruto when Jiraiya died  maybe someone will help him go back to his usual path.

Misamis52796062,0,@shinachiku_ns Tf is your problem . He never said minakushi was a parallel to narusaku . He just made a parallel of Sakura and kushina.  And Naruto is more like kushina.  Naruhina ship dynamics are like minakushi .I don't even care for any ship other than ss i am telling you what's canon idiot

Kakashi_Itachi_,0,#BORUTO #Boruto191  Kawaki's character development in the anime been really good so far  this episode showing some of his true character. Also enjoyed the interaction we got to see between Naruto and Kawaki at the end  Bonus weve not seen Naruto use that form in so long now ?
harunopink_,0,@narutomother_RP // Are you going to make that Naruto know that Sakura also likes him?

ShadowMichael,0,@Swagkage @Kiara2075 Except for the fact that if it wasn't for Ino and her abilities  most people would have died in the battlefield. Whereas  Sakura's role in the war was literally thrown away once naruto gave everyone the cloaks
suketcha1,0,@Boruto_EN I like naruto when hes a kid
Elis7777777,0,Ep.191: In this episode  I was very sorry for Kawaki  he became disillusioned with people  his life turned into hell because of such bad people around him. I really want Naruto to help him become a normal and kind person  support him  calm him down  like in the manga ... https://t.co/T9HLYMAVQM

KipAfterDark,0,@YesMommi But the real question is how much do you like Naruto ? Almost scared to ask if because I've always been made fun of  but man can I write about things like Rinnegan ascencion theories and how Zabuza and Kakashi working together could win vs the Six Paths of Pain ?
JideSzn,0,@dreamwLker_ I got Tom and Jerry too na? before naruto
itsumosad,0,@Mnny_Tz Still  they made sure to establish Sumire as the first person to see through him and connect and giving that speech to naruto is like the strongest erasure. If he wasn’t compassionate like that she would be locked up rn so why the please nanadaime
Vikingbread,0,@55_deal I don't think I want a live action Naruto tbh. Animes are usually too niche for western adaptations.   But if it were to happen  I'd go with Cillian Murphy as Orichomaru. But I fw  your suggestion.

narutokcm4,0,@Trap_Daddy12 @PrinceVegeta126 I’d say they would have this art style for the delta vs naruto fight and the big fights after that
OkisawaX,0,@ragoozer Honestly it does ruin games for example in a naruto cc u could have a kage running around killing normal players and u cant do anything about it. Specs shouldn't give u a clear advantage over other players.
K1NGWlZARD,0,@thegreenwitch__ Well i love naruto. The beginning of boruto was a little slow. But the main writer who was writing naruto came back to boruto cuz the previous team wasnt doing so good. So yeah Shits Hype asf now
Lxyamatji,0,@harshshinobi @itsumosad after a while he grows and develops his bond with naruto and boruto. Him being nice from the get go already diminishes his growth as the person who changed from not trusting and name calling to don't disrespect the seventh or a world without him has no meaning at all.
_RT_IfYouLove,0,Retweet if you love Naruto.
Lxyamatji,0,@harshshinobi @itsumosad +But kawaki starts off with trust issues and is more on edge  he is confused by naruto's kindness because he has never experienced anything but pain. The scene where the kid bumps into him shows that he's still weary and alert and doesn't feel safe just yet
